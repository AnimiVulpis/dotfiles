## Dotfiles Creed

These are my dotfiles.
There are many like it, but these ones are mine.

My dotfiles are my friends.
They are part of my developer life.
I must master them as I must master my life.

Without me, my dotfiles are useless.
Without my dotfiles, I am less useful.
I must keep my dotfiles true.
I will...

My dotfiles and I know that what counts in development is not the lines of code we write, the elegance of our functions, nor the comments we write.
We know that it is the results that count.
We will code...

My dotfiles are a developer, even as I, because they are part of my developer life.
Thus, I will learn them as a brother.
I will learn their weaknesses, their strengths, their parts, their accessories, their functions and their code.
I will keep my dotfiles clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready.
We will become part of each other.
We will...

Before the Internet, I swear this creed.
My dotfiles and I are the testers of my code.
We are the assignees of our issues.
We are the coders of my life.

So be it, until development is finished and there is no issue, but clean code!
